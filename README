NAME
    Date::Holidays::Abstract - an abstract class for Date::Holidays::*
    modules

SYNOPSIS
    package Date::Holidays::NN; use base qw(Date::Holidays::Abstract);

    sub holidays { ... }

    sub is_holiday { ... }

ABSTRACT
    This module is an abstract class intended for Date::Holidays::*

    The goal is to have all the existing and future modules implement the
    same methods, so they will have a uniform usage and can be used in
    polymorphic context or can be easily adapted into the Date::Holidays
    class.

DESCRIPTION
    If you want to use Date::Holidays::Abstract and want to comply with my
    suggestions to the methods that ought to be implemented, you should
    implement:

    is_holiday
    holidays

    Date::Holidays uses the requirements defined by this module and this
    module can therefor be used with success in conjunction with this.

    This is an alternative to making a super class. I have considered
    programming a super class, but since create a super class for a bunch of
    modules implementing handling of national holidays, an abstract class
    seemed a better choice.

    A super class for Date::Holidays, could implement is_holiday and
    holidays and expect these to be overloaded. Overloading would be
    necessary since nothing intelligent can be said about holidays without
    specifying a nationality (a part from holidays being nice but too few),
    and the implemented methods would be empty bodies returning empty result
    sets.

    So I am more for an abstract class and as stated I consider this class
    an experiment and I am still considering implementing
    Date::Holidays::Super.

    Suggestions for changes to this or extensions are more than welcome.

HEAD

- Updated Dist::Zilla configuration with more plugins to save more time

0.05 2007.03.13, maintenance release, update not necessary

- Added missing t/perlcriticrc

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a part of the
  normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment variable is set.

  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.
